âš¡ This artifact is based on an automation call to action from *"Cloud Computing for Data Analysis"* by Noah Gift, Ch. 1 **How to ship high-quality software that works and is on-time**.

This is an demonstration repo of a how to create a _Data Science focused Python project_.
There is a video on the setup of this demonstration repo here:

```

* run jupyter notebook:

```
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

* test jupyter notebook:

```
python -m pytest --nbval notebook.ipynb
```
